# 💡 Lumina

**A visual canvas for multimodal experiments and quick-share demos.**

Lumina is an interactive platform designed for **AI researchers, designers, and creators** to experiment with multimodal data—like text, images, audio, and video—on a single visual canvas.  
It allows users to **prototype, visualize, and share experiments** quickly and efficiently.

---

## 📖 Overview
Exploring AI across multiple data types can be complex. Lumina simplifies this by providing a **visual workspace** where you can:  
- Combine different modalities  
- Test AI models in real-time  
- Share results instantly  

This is ideal for rapid prototyping, demos, and experimentation without building a full application.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🖼 **Multimodal Canvas** – Drag and drop text, images, audio, and video.  
- ⚡ **Quick Prototyping** – Test AI models and workflows rapidly.  
- 🌐 **Instant Share** – Share experiments with collaborators via a link.  
- 🔄 **Interactive Visualization** – Explore outputs and relationships between modalities.  
- 💻 **Customizable Blocks** – Create reusable components for experiments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React / D3.js / Three.js  
- **Backend:** Python / FastAPI  
- **AI Models:** LLMs, image/audio/video processing models  
- **Database:** SQLite / JSON  
- **Deployment:** Docker / GitHub Pages / Cloud hosting
